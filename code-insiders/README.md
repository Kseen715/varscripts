# code-insiders

## PowerShell / PS1

Put `code-insiders.ps1` in your vscode-insiders `bin` folder.

```PATH
{your system drive}:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\bin
```

You also need to add the `bin` folder to your system `PATH`.

Now you can run `code-insiders` from the PowerShell. For example, to open the current folder in vscode-insiders:

```shell
code-insiders .
```

## Batch / CMD

`code-insiders.cmd` already should be in your vscode-insiders `bin` folder.

```PATH
{your system drive}:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\bin
```

You just need to add the `bin` folder to your system `PATH`.

Now you can run `code-insiders` from the CMD. For example, to open the current folder in vscode-insiders:

```shell
code-insiders .
```
